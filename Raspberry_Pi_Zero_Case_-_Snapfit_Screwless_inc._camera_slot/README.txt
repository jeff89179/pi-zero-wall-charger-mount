# Summary

Raspberry Pi Zero Case

+ Compatible with old & newer **Pi Zero** & **Pi Zero W** (includes a camera ribbon slot)
+ Snap fit design - no screws required.
+ "Coin slot" provided to prise lid open.
+ Easy to insert the Pi into the case
+ Screw Hole case for screwing through back of case for mounting 
+ Vented lids to let Pi breath
+ Small IO & larger IDE style connector slot version
+ Extra deep version is for use with IO port connector soldered to board, thus needing room for pins to stick out under the board. 

If using the internal screw holes, ensure the screw head is not going to short against the Pi, I'd recommend some electrical insulation tape over the top of the screw heads before mounting the Pi for peace of mind.

**Note:** You may need tweezers or fine nose pliers to take out the SD card once inserted, design compromise to keep the design simple and neat.

The Pi is very snug in its case to keep the footprint to smallest I could.
Feed camera ribbon through slot and insert into Pi, then lower Pi into place.

Note: OctoPi sticker is intended to be printed and stuck to front of one of the vented cases, or whatever else you want...
