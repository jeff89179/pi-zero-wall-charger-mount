Summary
This is a wall charger mount for the Raspberry Pi Zero/W/WH - no lid
It will hold the Pi right on a standard iPhone usb charger (5V, 1A), expose it's GPIO headers for projects and sensors.

I have not included a clip in this design. I may add it later from the original source file by TJT2007

Thanks to TJT2007 and DotNetWorker for the sources.

I will primarily be using this case as a way to keep the Pi close to where I have A/C floor registers so I can add a DS18B20 sensor to it to measure output temperatures.
